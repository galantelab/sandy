=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<SANDY> is a bioinformatics tool that provides a simple engine to simulate next-generation
sequencing for genomic and transcriptomic data. Simulated data works as experimental control
- a key step to optimize NGS analysis - in comparison to hypothetical models. SANDY is a
straightforward, easy-to-use, fast and highly customizable tool that generates reads requiring
only a FASTA file as input. SANDY can simulate single/paired-end reads from both whole exome
sequencing and RNA-seq as if produced from the most used second and third-generation sequencing
platforms. SANDYâ€™s reads can be simulated with genetic variations such as SNVs, indels and gene
fusions. For customization purposes, SANDY have built-in (native) databases that can be easily
extended with varying gene/transcript expression profiles, sequencing errors, sequencing
coverages and genomic variations.
